NLP - Natural Language Processing
Anticipate a group project

"Natural Language" = human language
- syntax can be very fluid
- lots of meaning through context

"Formal Language"
- a formal language is a grammer/syntax
- it's a language that's very rigid
- formal language is so rigid, that it's predicable.
- Examples:
    - math notation
    - chemistry notation
    - musical notation
    - logical notation
    - programming languages
        - Python
        - SQL
        - C, C#, C++, Objective C
        - ANY programming language


- NLP is bringing our programming and algorithmic chops to bear on understanding natural language
- NLP is an entire branch of CS/DS, it's not one or two algorithms

Examples of NLP project/tool/thing:
- Siri, google assitant
- voice to text (machine listening)
- language translation tools (from Spanish to French..)
- text to voice 
- automated helpdesk - Interactive Voice Response
- autocorrect and text prediction
- virtual chatbots (text responses/generation)
- web scraping bots 
- search engines
- regular language to regular expression tool
- hashtag, topic search #running but you search for #run and you see the thread b/c they share a root
- email filters - searching
- spam detection
- accessibility tools for hearing/sight impairment
- sentiment analysis (what's the tone of a document, is this a document of facts or opinions or positive/negative)
- topic modeling (unsupervised algorithm, trying to figure out what a document is all about)
- parts of speech tagging
- text normalization (removing as much variance from text without losing too much meaning - lowercasing everything)

## Topics we'll cover
- Regular expressions (kinda like a word/letter algebra for searching/replacing/filtering)
- Web scraping
- We'll do some exploration (this could be its own 6 month course)
- classification modeling 
- NLP project is classifying the programming language of a repo off of GitHub based only on that repo's README file.

## End Goal for y'all w/ this module
1. Enough regex to be dangerous (regex is a tool for your toolbox)
2. Enough web scraping and html parsing to be useful (to build your own datasets)
3. Modeling goal is to build your own dataset and perform classification on that labeled dataset
