[{"title":"Is a Career in Tech Recession-Proof?","date":"Aug 12, 2022","category":"Cloud Administration","content":"Given the current economic climate, many economists are considering the U.S. to be entering a recession. This can cause confusion, fear, and uncertainty, especially as it pertains to job security. To ease some of those feelings, below you\u2019ll find some careers in tech that tend to hold up better than others amid a recession. In the event of a recession, companies will likely shift to digital strategies, making these careers in tech valuable and highly coveted.     Programmer\/Developer No matter the programming language you\u2019ve mastered, having the knowledge alone makes you extremely valuable. The coding skills you possess as a programmer or developer are in-demand for companies looking to build or enhance their websites, and enhance their consumer experience. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs in software development are expected to grow 22% by 2030. This is much faster than the average career.
